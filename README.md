# This Repository contains projects related to Finance domain. 

### Project 1:-
This project was done as a part of my Graduate Research Assistant project. The project helped to study the effect of public sentiment on stock’s price before and after Covid-19. Using python-built Risk models (Fama French factors) for various dummy portfolio and provided insights on the risk. Further forecasted risk using VaR technique by implementing a Monte Carlo Simulation for the given portfolio. Lastly, using sentiment analysis (NLP) tried to check causation between stock pricing and people’s sentiment. Worked on web scraping automation for companies’ review text data using API, Selenium, Octoparse tools from websites such as Facebook, Yelp and Twitter.
## Project 1:- 
Develope a VaR (Value at Risk) model using the Covariance matrix of the potfolio stock and run the Monte Carlo simuation for a definite window of period upto where we want o visualize the risk. Develope Regression model (OLS lib) in python to check the factors associated with risk. Download the Fama French data (3 Factors) for the dummy portfolios from Website. https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html. Finally use the scraped data from website such as Yahoo finance, Facebook, Twitter API to develope a sentiment analysis model and compare the stock price movement of some risk stocks with sentiment analysis score derived from text data. Use Granger causality test to check the interpretability of the sentiment score.
Part 1:- Run VaR model Link:-  https://github.com/prathameshk30/Python-for-Finance/blob/main/Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Stock_Prediction.ipynb
Part 2:- develope a  Fama French model
Part 3:- Use sentiment analysis to check the causality. Link:- https://github.com/prathameshk30/Python-for-Finance/blob/main/FinBERT_%26_WandB.ipynb

### Project 2:- 
The project was done as a part of graded assisgnment to find fraud for a retail comapny using transaction and customer data. The problem was to find fraudulent customers for a retail company using past data. Two tables were provided, transaction and customer identity for identifying AML patterns among customers. Feature engineering on the transactional data to generate features. Used unsupervised learning Isolation Forest for verification of anomalies in transaction data. Trained and selected GBM, KNN classification model on various provided labels (Fraud, Type- 1, Type-2) to identify the fraudulent customer. Further used API to fetch location data using IP address, to cross verify with given residential address for fraudulent customer.

### Project 3:-
A project done on lease renewal risk analysis. Used various statistical tests such as Chi squared (goodness of fit), G-test, Monte Carlo simulation method to check the risk of customers that were not renewing the lease. Finally, used Kmodes clustering algorithm to group the customer to find common groups of retractor and detractor.
